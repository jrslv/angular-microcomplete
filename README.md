angular-microcomplete
=====================

AngularJS directive for [tab] shell-like autocomplete.

Enables autocomplete in HTML input tag and deals with the default behavior, when on [tab] the focus is changed to a next element.

The usage is as easy as

```
<input type="text" ng-model="sentence" microcomplete="sentence" source="terms" />
```

Cheers
